# Compatiblitiy List for DAMX:
If your device isn’t listed in the compatibility table — don’t worry! You can still download and try DAMX. If your laptop is compatible, it may work out of the box. If not, you can add support by creating a custom configuration for your system.

DAMX is primarily built for modern Acer laptops (2022 and newer) that use WMI protocols.

✅ Officially tested distributions: Ubuntu 25+ and Kubuntu 25+
✅ Minimum required kernel version: Linux 6.13+

> Note: This compatibility list simply reflects devices where the DAMX Suite has been confirmed to work.
>
>If your Acer laptop is not listed but works correctly or partially with DAMX, please help improve the project by filing an issue with your model details — so others can benefit from your discovery.

Please also check out the [FAQ Page](https://github.com/PXDiv/Div-Acer-Manager-Max/blob/main/FAQ.md) to know how to get your model to work even though it's not supported, and you can even help others by creating a quirk config and for your model and creating a merge request.
